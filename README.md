# Introduction

Multiplying large numbers as strings ( Large integer multiplication )

Algo 1 : The grad School algorith for multiplying two numbers has a complexity of n^3 and is slower

Algo 2 : The Karatsuba's algorithm is a formula that allows one to compute the product of two large numbers x and y using three multiplications of smaller numbers, each with about half as many digits as x or y, plus some additions and digit shifts.
The Karatsuba's algorithm divides a number into two parts on each itteration, and has a complexity of n^1.58

Algo 3 : The new algorithm is same as Karatsuba's algo except that it divides a number into 3 parts, and has a complexity of n^2.
